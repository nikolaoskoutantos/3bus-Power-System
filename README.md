#### Installation
  Based on the official docs, which could be found [here](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.0/install.html).

## Features 

HF is a B2B oriented blockchain without an underlying asset.As an Open Source it is free os usage.
Moreover it supports SDKs for GoLand, Java, Node.js and Python and the corresponding samples could be found in the ```smart-contracts``` folder.


## Future Work

Smart Contracts for settlement of the cost functions and the wrap-up of the ```pandapower``` && ```HF smart-contract``` in a Decentrilized Application.\
HF has also a lot of upcoming [events](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/labs/calendar)(kept here for easy access).
